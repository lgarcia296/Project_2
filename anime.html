      <h1>My Favorite Anime</h1>
      <p>I first started watching anime during Covid-19, and ever since that time, I've watched more than 30 anime series. Here are my top 3 favorites.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>#3 Naruto</h2>
      <div>
        <img src="images/naruto.jpg" alt="Naruto series logo">
        <p>Naruto is one of my favorite anime that I've watched, and it's in my third spot because I enjoy watching every fight that appeared and the story it told. It also led me to find many similar animes that I now enjoy watching.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>#2 Bleach</h2>
      <div>
        <img src="images/bleach.jpg" alt="Bleach series logo">
        <p>Bleach is an anime that has a very interesting story that I enjoy since it's pretty much sword fighting. That is why it's on my second spot for my list; the fights and animation for Bleach are something I enjoy watching.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>#1 Yu-Gi-Oh</h2>
      <div>
        <img src="images/yugioh.jpg" alt="Yu-Gi-Oh series logo">
        <p>On my number one spot, I choose Yu-Gi-Oh since I started to watch and play it when I was in 4th grade. Ever since I started to watch Yu-Gi-Oh, I never forgot about it, and I still buy packs to play with the cards. Even to this day, I still have over 100 cards in my room as a precious memory that I will always keep.</p>
